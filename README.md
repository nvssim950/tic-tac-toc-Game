# tic-tac-toc-Game
This is a simple and interactive Tic-Tac-Toe game implemented with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game allows two players to compete against each other in a classic 3x3 grid. Players take turns marking their spots with either 'X' or 'O', and the first player to align three of their marks horizontally, vertically, or diagonally wins the game.
